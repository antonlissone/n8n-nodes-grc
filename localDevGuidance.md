Run with npm run dev:fast

This command starts the development server in fast mode, which enables quicker rebuilds during local development. It watches for file changes and automatically recompiles the code, making it ideal for iterative development and testing of n8n nodes.

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
